# smol-torch
A toy clone of Pytorch Deep Learning Library with C and Python C API.

## Inspo
Just wanted to learn c and python in depth and didnt know a better way. Plus I get to read the torch codebase so, yay!

## Features
 - Tensor creation and printing
 - Shape method
## Todos
 - Maybe have some tensor ops like addition and matmul
 - View and reshape
 - gradient tracking for backprop
 - Sth like `nn.Linear`
